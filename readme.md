### Overview

Memory Space is derivative of the Memory/Concentration game, where a user looks for pairs of the same image.  I originally logged the points, but decided to change to clicks since it number of points would always be the same the a 12 card board.

I was originally planning to include instructions, but decided not to after user testing.  Discovery process was enough that even users unfamiliar with the game were able to quickly pick up (and were delightedly suprised when they figured it out and saw the images).

### Technology

I used javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 with GitHub providing the site hosting.  I used 17 functions to build, and wish I had created more functions from the start.  In many cases I would have to put code within a function so that I could call in multiple scenarios.  

The game works really well and there aren't any known bugs.  I spent a substantial amount of time troubleshooting minor bugs that enhanced the over quality of the experience.  I had a 'reset' button but moved it to a separate branch when I realized I wouldn't have enough time to get it working properly.  

### Feature Backlog:
 * Fix reset button
 * Add a timer so users can play for speed
 * Add a feature so that users can view the pictures after winning
 * Ability to add more cards to the game
