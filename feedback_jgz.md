# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. I love to see such an extensive commit history! That's super important, and will really be handy when you get into group work too. Really good user stories too, but maybe also some pseudo-code would be great! The readme should also include installation instructions.  It does not seem too important with this project, given that you only need to open the index.html file.  But, moving forward it's super important, as we start getting into package managers and things like that!

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project shows a really good understanding of the concepts and materials we've covered so far! You've touched on almost everything we've taught in class at this point.  I'd challenge you to to try and take a more object oriented approach during the refactoring! Really like that you've done some commenting in your code.  That will be super helpful moving forward, keep that up.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**.  Please review my inline comments (prefixed with my initials - "JGZ") for suggestions to help improve code quality.  My biggest note is to be very careful about the global variable declarations.  I saw a lot of variables created without "var" preceding them. Your HTML and CSS ran through the validator with no issues! I'd challenge you to think about building your board using JS instead of just having divs created in the HTML file already. Maybe something to push yourself to do during refactor?

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** You're commit history shows you approached this in a great way! Taking it step by step, and then cleaning it up once you have something functional.  I like the reset branch, so maybe give a couple of the other features a try too!
