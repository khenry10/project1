Bronze MVP: 1 user clicks to find matches and wins when he synchronously selects matched pairs. (minimal to no styling)

User Stories;
[x] As a user, I can't see the pairs until I click on one
  -- Unless I click preview
[x] As a user, I get points when I find matched pairs
  -- points are lame, least amount of clicks is more fun
[x] As a user, I win when when I find all matched pairs
[x] As a user, the game resets with I win
[x] As a user, the pairs are in different places when the game resets

Bugs:
[x] User can click on the same box 2 times in a row and it will count as a match
[] hover-over effect on cards goes away after resetting
[x] User is able to click on the area's of the disappeared cards, and you see the image
